    <p>Brown Outdoor Leadership Training is a Brown University program that teaches leadership and outdoor skills to
        rising
        sophomores and upperclassmen trip leaders through trips to the White Mountains in New Hampshire. This community
        has
        been an integral part of my undergraduate experience.</p>
    <p>In Fall 2022, BOLT's steering committee, of which I was a member, was tasked with redesigning the curriculum we
        use
        to train our new backpacking trip leaders. This overhaul included minor things like updating links to
        references, to
        starting some trainings, such as "Wellness on Trail" from ground zero. When committee members perused the old
        lesson
        plans, they found them difficult to read and also non-standardized. I, particularly concerned about this
        problem,
        decided to tackle it in addition to the curricular reforms I was participating in.</p>
    <p>By creating this new layout, with a brand-new cover page detailing need-to-know-information, in addition to
        typography edits throughout the document, I was able to create a more readable, and thus effective, lesson plan
        for
        the next semester's trainings.</p>

    <h2>Part I - Rough Draft Designs</h2>
    <div>
        <p>To begin this project, I created a couple of sketches to test out what the layout of the website would look
            like. I tried three different designs, each of which had different emphases on the first page and different
            hierarchies in the subsequent pages. The results of this experimentation are below:
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3> Feedback from Steering Committee</h3>
        <p>The steering committee had the following feedback on the designs:
        <ol>
            <li> They really enjoyed having the quick-reference information on the cover page of the training so that
                they could easily access it, but they thought that using icons form the other designs could be helpful
                in guiding the reader.
            <li>They expressed that they enjoyed designs that limited their use of bullet points and that had a clear hierarchy, unlike the current design.
            <li> They wished they could see more clearly what the schedule of the evening was without having to reference the headings on each of the multiple pages.
        </ol>
        </p>
    </div>
    <!-- part 2 -->
    <div>
        <h3>Part II - Prototype</h3>
        <div>
            After hearing the response from the committee, I created a hi-fi prototype of the document within Google
            Docs, the tool we use to coillaboratively create the websites. An interactive display of the prototype is
            included below:
        </div>
        <h4>Feedback from Steering Committee + Implementation</h4>
        <div>
            <p>After the prototype, there were not many substantative comments the steering committee held, but they had
                a couple of tweaks for me which I implemented.
            <ol>
                <li> Add a 'in charge of' column on the first page to allow people to more easily allow facilitators to
                    check what they are responsible for teaching.
                <li> Find ways to make it easy to navigate between lessons (like there are tabs in a spreadsheet)
                <li> Create a way to differentiate between energizers/breaks and more serious material in the lessons.
            </ol>
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusions & Takeaways</h2>
    <div class="list">
        <ul>
            <li> Workshopping design in groups is necessary to ensure that the design being created is as best as
                possible.
            <li> Designs of a template should not only work individually, but should allow cross-lesson or
                cross-implementation collaboration.
            <li> Providing necessary information up-front in a document (or any other layout) assists greatly in
                enabling allowing users to easily and quickly reference important information.
