                Project Description
            </h2>
            <p>
                For this project, I evaluated the efficacy of the microwave in the basement lounge of Maxcy Hall
                (Brown's Urban
                Studies and Sociology building). To perform
                this evaluation I:
            <ol>
                <li>Took observations and interviewed of users of the microwaves.</li>
                <li>Created empathy maps for personas based on my observational data.</li>
                <li>Drew out a storyboard detailing an interaction of one of my personas with the microwave's
                    interface.</li>
            </ol>
            This evaluation allowed me to understand the importance of intuitive affordances, along with detailed user
            observation, to create inclusive, effective prototypes and designs. It also exposed me to the power of
            storyboards and personas in helping to understand and adapt designs to potential uses.

                            This keypad to the right of the microwave allows the user to set the settings and time for
                            the use of the device (typically to heat or reheat food/drinks). The top of the microwave
                            has a clock that changes to a timer display while the microwave is on. Below that is a
                            cluster of presets for different types of food and then below that there is a
                            numeric keypad for entering the time to cook the device. The next cluster has miscellaneous
                            settings, while the bottom has buttons to start, reset, and set the microwaves functions.

            <h2> Questions and Responses
            </h2>
            <h4> What were your motivations for using the microwave’s keypad?
            </h4>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li> Person 1: I wanted pop popcorn to eat while studying.
                    </li>
                    <li> Person 2: To put in the time to make my leftovers.
                    </li>
                    <li> Person 3: To heat up some water for some tea. </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <h4> Which buttons do you use most? Which ones do you use least? How did you make this decision?
            </h4>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li> I only use the popcorn button and the numeric keypad. I use the least the defrost and power
                        settings. Only start, stop, minute settings.
                    </li>
                    <li> I use the timepad the most. Don’t get what the popcorn and potato mean. It doesn’t make sense
                        to me. I also don’t get the power button. Can the microwave be stronger or weaker? I do not use
                        any of these at all. I do not understand any of the buttons except the time buttons, because I
                        do not trust the microwave programmer.
                    </li>
                    <li> I like to use the 'add one minute' function. I usually put my food into the microwave for a
                        minute then check it then try it again at those one minute intervals. I never use the defrost
                        features, as they confuse me. </li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <h4> Did you encounter hiccups while using the microwave? If so what?
            </h4>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li> Not really, the main struggle I have is trying to figure out how long it will take for the
                        popcorn to pop but I usually judge that by when the popcorn stops popping. </li>
                    <li> I don't encounter hiccups when I stick to my timepad. </li>
                    <li> I always cannot figure out the right amount of time to cook my food!</li>
                </ol>
            </div>
            <h4> If you could replace one feature on the microwave with another, new function, which would you replace?
            </h4>
            <div>
                <ol>
                    <li> Some microwaves have a function called sensory heat, and I would use that instead of one of the
                        weight features. </li>
                    <li> Add a mute button so I don’t disturb other people when I make my food. </li>
                    <li> To be honest, I wouldn't add any buttons, there are just so many to pick from that I feel
                        overwhelmed when I approach the microwave.
                        I would say goodbye easiest to the 'by weight' feature and potato cook button, however. </li>

    <h2>Conclusions & Takeaways</h2>
    <div class="list">
        <ul>
            <li> Many people use the same device in different ways --- as designers we need to design for all different
                uses (and even misuses) to ensure usability and accessibility. 
            <li>User research and persona/storyboard creating are essential to ensure that products are effective at
                their objective and easy-to-use and understand for all users, not just some archetypes. Doing these experiments on this microwave unearthed many
                problems that could be implemented if the microwave were to be redesigned.
            <li> Phrasing of questions, in addition to how you approach people when doing user research, is very
                important and often results in different outcomes/answers.
